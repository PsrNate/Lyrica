Lyrica
======

A Touhou-specialized social network ! This project mainly aims at
centralizing replays and scores so as to create rankings. It should
therefore contain some advanced social functions such as messaging, comparing
or send matches replays - considering, for instance, Phantasmagoria games.
There should therefore be player rankings based on ELO indicators as well.

As of today the project started a few months ago and I'm still in the first
steps of figuring out how the website's general outline should be. Lyrica
is probably going to be written in French - even though it will be developed
and commented in English; but translating it to English, Japanese or other
languages is obviously planned on a longer time scale.
